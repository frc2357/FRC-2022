### Programming TODO List

- IR Sensors need debouncing
- Need to install feeder sensor and check code

- Climber: Set up pneumatics control in subsystem like Intake is, with delay and such
- Climber: Use setClosedLoopEnabled() when seeking to a specific position

- Add "Target Lock" mode to main Robot class
- Set up Limelight pipelines
- Save Limelight files to repo
- Add Limelight camera to shuffleboard
- Add toggling of pipeline for "Target Lock" mode

- Install intake camera and RPi on robot
- Ensure PhotonVision comes up on robot
- Add intake camera to shuffleboard 

- Get shuffleboard all set up and dialed in (hopefully not recreate it each time)

- Make copy of RPi SD card for backup/spare purposes
